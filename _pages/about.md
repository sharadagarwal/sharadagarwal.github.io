I enjoy innovating in cloud services, from distributed systems layers down
through to the networking stack, and have created new cloud services as well as
scaled & improved the performance of existing ones. My background is that of a
computer science researcher and engineer with 16 years at [Microsoft
Research](http://research.microsoft.com/).

I have advanced the state-of-the-art in several technical areas, including
scalable cloud services, latency in multiplayer games, and geo-distributed
online services. I have co-authored 40 academic publications with over 7,000
citations, and co-invented 83 issued patents. I have served on over 60
committees for international conferences, workshops, journals and the NSF.

I have worked closely with Microsoft business groups in my research and have
impacted products, including Azure, Windows 10, and Windows Phone 8. Together
with a small team of researchers and engineers, I have designed, implemented and
stood up a scalable cloud service on Azure that has served over 21 million
users. I recently became an ACM Distinguished Engineer for outstanding
engineering contributions to computing.

I am an active angel investor in the Pacific Northwest. I have 22 startups in my
portfolio, including YCombinator graduates and companies that have gone on to
raise from successful VC firms. I mentor startup founders through
[Grubstakes](https://grubstakes.vc), [Venture Out](https://ventureoutstartups.com),
and other groups in Seattle.
