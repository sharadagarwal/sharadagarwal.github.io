I am building AI systems at Microsoft, including a multi-agent AI system for
automating SaaS incident management, AI model selection and routing, automatic
debugging for multi-agent AI calls, and media provenance for AI training and
inference. Previously, I used AI+ML to solve challenging scale problems in
Azure, built a scalable cloud service on Azure that served over 21 million
Windows 10 users, and optimized the Windows Phone 8 networking stack.

I am an [ACM Distinguished
Engineer](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2017/november/distinguished-members-2017).
I am an inventor on over 100 issued patents. I have authored over [45 academic
publications](https://sharadagarwal.net/publications/) with over [9,000
citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csgUXLsAAAAJ&hl=en) and an
[H-index of 45](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csgUXLsAAAAJ&hl=en). I
have served on over [60 academic
committees](https://sharadagarwal.net/professional/).

I am an angel investor in over 20 startups, some having graduated from Y
Combinator, and raised capital from large VC firms. I have mentored and invested
in startup founders through [Grubstakes](https://grubstakes.vc) and other groups
in Seattle.
