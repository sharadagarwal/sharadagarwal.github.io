I am an experienced tech innovator in cloud computing, networking, and
distributed systems. I have applied ML to solve challenging scale problems in
Azure, built a scalable cloud service on Azure to serve >21 million users
including on Windows 10, and optimized the Windows Phone 8 networking stack.

I am an [ACM Distinguished

I am a co-inventor on over 140 issued patents. I have co-authored over [40
academic publications](https://sharadagarwal.net/publications/), including at
NSDI, SIGCOMM, MobiSys, and USENIX ATC, with over [8,000
citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csgUXLsAAAAJ&hl=en) and an
[H-index of 43](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csgUXLsAAAAJ&hl=en). I
have served on over [60 academic
committees](https://sharadagarwal.net/professional/).

As an active angel investor, I have over 20 startups in my portfolio, some
