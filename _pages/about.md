I enjoy innovating in cloud services and distributed systems by producing and
then integrating computer science research into products, including Azure,
Windows 10, and Windows Phone 8. I have advanced the state-of-the-art in several
technical areas, including scalable cloud services, latency in multiplayer
games, and geo-distributed online services. Together with a small team of
researchers and engineers, we have designed, implemented and stood up a scalable
cloud service on Azure that has served over 21 million users. 

With 16 years at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/), I have
co-authored over [40 academic publications](https://sharadagarwal.net/publications/)
with over [7,700 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csgUXLsAAAAJ&hl=en),
and co-invented 85 issued patents. I have served on over [60 committees](https://sharadagarwal.net/professional/)
for international conferences, workshops, journals and the NSF. I am an
[ACM Distinguished Engineer](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2017/november/distinguished-members-2017)
for outstanding engineering contributions to computing.

As an active angel investor in the Pacific Northwest, I have 22 startups in my
portfolio, some having graduated from YCombinator, and many having raised
capital from large VC firms. I mentor startup founders through
[Grubstakes](https://grubstakes.vc), [Venture Out](https://ventureoutstartups.com),
and other groups in Seattle. You can find out more about me and contact me via my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharadagarwal2/) profile.
